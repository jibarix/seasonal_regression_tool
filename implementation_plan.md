# Implementation Plan for Seasonal Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This implementation plan outlines how to transform the current monolithic `regression_forecast.py` and related files into a modular, extensible framework for time series analysis with seasonal components. The new structure will allow for more sophisticated analysis while maintaining compatibility with the existing data pipeline, particularly the output from `export_data.py`.
